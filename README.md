The tests reflect results under Linux
using GNU utilities. For performance,
the main focus is on the features found
in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
rather than `sh`
[POSIX 2018](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
compliant shells. The term "compliant"
is used here as "most POSIX compliant",
as there is no, and has never been,
shell that is
fully POSIX compliant.
POSIX is useful if you are looking for
more portable scripts. See also POSIX in
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX).

> Please note that `sh` here refers to
> modern, best-of-effort POSIX-compatible,
> minimal shells like
> [dash](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash) and
> [posh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/posh).
> See section [PORTABILITY, SHELLS AND POSIX](#posix-shells-and-portability).

In Linux like systems, from a performance point
of view, for serious shell scripting, Bash is
the sensible choice for efficient data
manipulation in memory with
[arrays](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arrays.html),
associative arrays, and strings
with an extended set of parameter
expansions, regular expressions, including
extracting regex matches and utilizing fast
functions with namerefs.

In other operating systems, for example BSD,
the obvious choice for shell scripting would be
fast
[Ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell)
([ksh93](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ksh93u+m),
[mksh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mksh),
etc.), unless an
extended set of features only found in Bash are
needed.

Shell scripting is about combining redirections,
pipes, calling external utilities, and gluing them
all together. Shell scripts are also quite
portable by default, requiring no additional
installation.
[Perl](https://www.perl.org)
or
[python](https://www.python.org)
excel in their
respective fields, where the requirements differ
from those of the shell.

Certain features in Bash are slow, but
knowing the cold spots and using
alternatives helps. On the other hand,
small POSIX `sh`, for example dash, scrips
are much faster at calling
external processes and functions. More
about this in section
[SHELLS AND PERFORMANCE](#32-shells-and-performance).

The results presented in this README provide
only some highlighs from the test cases
listed in RESULTS. Consider the raw
[`time`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Reserved-Words)
results only as guidance, as they reflect only
the system used at the time of testing.
Instead, compare the relative order in which
each test case produced the fastest results.

# 3.0 ABOUT PERFORMANCE

## 3.1 GENERAL PERFORMANCE ADVICE

Regardless of the shell you use for scripting
([sh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash),
[ksh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ksh93u+m),
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)),
consider these factors.

- If you run scripts on many small files, set
  up a RAM disk and copy the files to it. This
  can lead to massive speed gains. In Linux, see
  [tmpfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs),
  which allows you to set a size limit, unlike
  the memory-hogging
  [ramfs](https://wiki.debian.org/ramfs),
  which can fill all available memory and
  potentially halt your server.

- If you know the files beforehand, preload
  them into memory. This can also lead to
  massive speed gains.
  In Linux, see [vmtouch](https://hoytech.com/vmtouch/).

- If you have tasks that can be run concurrently,
  use
  [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
  based
  [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
  for massive gains in performance.
  See also how to use
  [semaphores](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/sem.html#understanding-a-semaphore)
  ([tutorial](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/parallel_examples.html#example-working-as-mutex-and-counting-semaphore))
  to wait for all concurrent tasks to finish
  before continuing with the rest of the tasks in
  the pipeline. In some cases, even parallelizing
  work with GNU
[`xargs --max-procs=0`](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/xargs-options.html) can help.

- Use GNU utilities. According to
  benchmarks, like
  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22661643),
  the GNU `grep` is considerably faster and more
  optimized than the operating system's
  default. To increase performance in
  shell scripts, consider installing GNU
  [coreutils](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/coreutils),
  GNU
  [grep](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/grep),
  GNU
  [awk](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gawk),
  and if needed, arrange `PATH` to prefer
  GNU utilities (for example, on macOS).

- Minimize extra processes as much as possible.
  In most cases, a single
  [awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)
  can handle all of
  [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/),
  [`cut`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html),
  [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/)
  etc.
  chains. The `awk` binary program is *very*
  fast and more efficient than
  [Perl](https://www.perl.org)
  or
  [Python](https://www.python.org)
  scripts where startup time and higher
  memory consumption is a factor.
  *Note*: If you need to process large files,
  use a lot of regular expressions, manipulate or
  work on data extensively, there is probably
  nothing that can replace the speed of `perl`
  unless you go even lower-level languages like
  `C`. But then again, we assume that you know
  how to choose your tools in those cases.

```bash
    cmd | awk '{...}'

    # ... could probably
    # replace all of these

    cmd | head ... | cut ...
    cmd | grep ... | sed ...
    cmd | grep ... | grep -v ... | cut ...
```

- *Note*: if you have hordes of RAM,
  no shortage of cores, and large files, then
  utilize pipelines `<cmd> | ...` as much as
  possible because the Linux Kernel will optimize
  things in memory better. In more powerful
  systems, many latency and performance issues are
  not as relevant.

- Use Shell built-ins
  (see [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html))
  and not binaries:

```bash
    echo     # not /usr/bin/echo
    printf   # not /usr/bin/printf
    [ ... ]  # not /usr/bin/test
```

## 3.2 SHELLS AND PERFORMANCE

TODO

## 3.3 MAJOR PERFORMANCE GAINS

- In Bash, It is about 100 times faster to perform
  regular expression string matching using the
  binary op rather than to calling external
  POSIX utilities
  [`expr`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/expr.html)
  or
  [`grep`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html).

  **But**: In POSIX shell scripts, like
  `dash`, calling utilities is
  *extremely* fast. Compared to Bash,
  `[[]]`, the Dash's  `expr` is only 5x
  slower, which is negligible because the
  time differences are measured in mere few
  milliseconds.

```bash
    string="abcdef"
    re="b.*e"

    # Bash, Ksh
    [[ $string =~ $re ]]

    # In Bash, 100x slower
    expr match "$string" ".*$re"

    # In Bash, 140x slower
    echo "$string" | grep -E "$re"

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    ./run.sh --shell dash,ksh93,bash t-string-match-regexp.sh

    Run shell: dash
    # t1 IsFeatureMatchRegexp <skip>
    # t2                      real 0.010s
    # t3                      real 0.010s
    Run shell: ksh93
    # t1                      real 0.001s
    # t2                      real 0.139s
    # t3                      real 0.262s
    Run shell: bash
    # t1                      real 0.003s
    # t2                      real 0.200s
    # t3                      real 0.348s
```

- In Bash, it is about more than 50 times
  faster to do string manipulation in memory,
  than calling external utilities.
  Seeing the measurements just how
  expensive it is, reminds us to utilize the
  possibilities of basic `#` `##` `%` `%%`
[parameter expansions](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_06_02)
and more in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion)
  to their fullest.
  See [code](./bin/t-string-file-path-components.sh).

```bash
    str="/tmp/filename.txt.gz"

    # (1) Almost instantaneous
    # Delete up till first "."
    ext=${str#*.}

    # (2) In Bash, over 50x slower
    ext=$(echo "$str" | cut --delimiter="." --fields=2,3)

    # (2) In Bash, over 70x slower
    ext=$(echo "$str" | sed --regexp-extended 's/^[^.]+//')

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    ./run.sh --shell dash,ksh93,bash t-string-file-path-components.sh
    Run shell: dash
    # t3aExt                  real 0.009s (1)
    # t3cExt                  real 0.008s (2)
    # t3eExt                  real 0.009s (3)
    Run shell: ksh93
    # t3aExt                  real 0.001s
    # t3cExt                  real 0.193s
    # t3eExt                  real 0.288s
    Run shell: bash
    # t3aExt                  real 0.004s
    # t3cExt                  real 0.358s
    # t3eExt                  real 0.431s

```

- In Bash, it is about 10 times faster
  to read a file
  into memory as a string and use
  [pattern matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pattern-Matching)
  or Bash regular expressions
  binary operator
  [`=~`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-_005b_005b)
  on string. In-memory handling is much more
  efficient than calling the `grep` command on a
  file, especially if multiple matches are
  needed.
  See [code](./bin/t-file-grep-vs-match-in-memory.sh).

```bash
    # Bash, Ksh
    str=$(< file)

    if [[ $str =~ $regexp1 ]]; then
        ...
    elif [[ $str =~ $regexp2 ]]; then
        ...
    fi

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    ./run.sh --shell dash,ksh93,bash t-file-grep-vs-match-in-memory.sh
    Run shell: dash
    # t1b                     real 0.023s read once + case..end
    # t2                      real 0.018s loop do.. grep file ..done
    # t3                      real 0.021s loop do.. case..end ..done
    Run shell: ksh93
    # t1b                     real 0.333s
    # t2                      real 0.208s
    # t3                      real 0.453s
    Run shell: bash
    # t1b                     real 0.048s
    # t2                      real 0.277s
    # t3                      real 0.415s
```

- In Bash, it is about 8 times faster, to use
  [nameref](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameters)
  to return a value.
  The `ret=$(fn)` is inefficient to call functions.
  On the other hand, in POSIX-like `sh` shells
  there is practically no overhead in
  using `$(fn)`.
  See [code](./bin/t-function-return-value-nameref.sh).

```bash
    # Not needed in POSIX sh
    # shells as ret=$(fn) is already fast.

    fnNamerefPosix() # dash
    {
        # NOTE: uses non-POSIX 'local'
        # but it is widely supported in
        # POSIX-like shells:
        # dash, posh, mksh, ksh93...

        local retref=$1
        shift
        local arg=$1

        eval "$retref=\$arg"
    }

    fnNamerefBash()
    {
        local -n retref=$1
        shift
        local arg=$1

        retref=$arg
    }

    # Return value returned to
    # variable 'ret'

    fnNamerefPosix ret "arg"
    fnNamerefBash ret "arg"

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    ./run.sh --shell dash,ksh93,bash t-function-return-value-nameref.sh
    Run shell: dash
    # t1 IsShellBash          <skip>      fnNamerefBash
    # t2                      real 0.006s fnNamerefPosix
    # t3                      real 0.005s ret=$(fn)

    Run shell: ksh93
    # t1 IsShellBash          <skip>      fnNamerefBash
    # t2                      real 0.004s
    # t3                      real 0.005s

    Run shell: bash
    # t1                      real 0.006s
    # t2                      real 0.006s
    # t3                      real 0.094s ret=$(fn)
```

- In Bash, it is about 2 times faster to for
  line-by-line handling to read the file into
  an array and then loop through the array.
  If you're wondering about
  [`readarray`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html#index-readarray)
  vs
  [`mapfile`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-mapfile),
  there is no difference.
  Built-in `readarray`is a synonym for `mapfile`.
  See [code](./bin/t-file-read-content-loop.sh).

```bash
    # Bash
    readarray -t array < file

    for line in "${array[@]}"
    do
        ...
    done

    # POSIX. Slower
    while read -r line
    do
        ...
    done < file
```

- It is about 2 times faster to prefilter with `grep`
  to process only certain lines
  instead of reading the whole file
  into a loop and then selecting lines. Bash
  loops are generally slow. The
  [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)
  is more general because variables persist after the loop.
  The `dash` is very fast compared to Bash.
  See [code](./bin/t-file-read-match-lines-loop-vs-grep.sh).

```bash
    # Bash
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done < <(grep "$re" file)

    # POSIX
    # Problem: while runs in
    # a separate environment
    grep "$re" file) |
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done

    # POSIX
    # Note: extra calls
    # required for tmpfile
    grep "$re" file) > tmpfile
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done < tmpfile
    rm tmpfile

    # Bash, Slowest,
    # in-loop prefilter
    while read -r line
    do
       [[ $line =~ $re ]] || continue
       ...
    done < file

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    ./run.sh --shell dash,ksh93,bash t-file-read-match-lines-loop-vs-grep.sh
    Run shell: dash
    # t1a                     real 0.015s grep prefilter before loop
    # t2a                     real 0.012s loop: case...esac
    Run shell: ksh93
    # t1a                     real 2.940s
    # t2a                     real 1.504s
    Run shell: bash
    # t1a                     real 4.567s
    # t2a                     real 10.88s

```

## 3.4 MODERATE PERFORMANCE GAINS

- It is about 10 times faster to split a string
  into an array using list rather than
  using Bash here-string. This is because
  [HERE STRING](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Here-Strings)
  `<<<` uses a
  pipe or temporary file, whereas Bash list
  operates entirely in memory. The pipe
  buffer behavor was introduced in
  [Bash 5.1 section c](https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/master/CHANGES).
  *Warning*: Please note that using the `(list)`
  statement will undergo pathname expansion
  so globbing characters
  like `*`, `?`, etc. in string would be a problem.
  The pathname expansion
  can be disabled.
  See [code](./bin/t-variable-array-split-string.sh).

```bash
    str="1:2:3"

    # Bash, Ksh. Fastest.
    IFS=":" eval 'array=($str)'

    fn() # Bash
    {
        local str=$1

        # Make 'set' local
        local -

        # Disable pathname
        # expansion
        set -o noglob

        local -a array

        IFS=":" eval 'array=($str)'
        ...
    }

    # Bash. Slower than 'eval'.
    IFS=":" read -ra array <<< "$str"

    # In Linux, see what Bash uses
    # for HERE STRING: pipe or
    # temporary file
    bash -c 'ls -l --dereference /proc/self/fd/0 <<< hello'
```

- It is about 2 times faster to read file
  into a string using Bash command substitution
  [`$(< file)`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Substitution).
  The dash `$(cat file)` is about 20 times faster than Bash.
  See [code](./bin/t-file-read-into-string.sh).

```bash
    # Bash
    string=$(< file)

    # In Bash: 1.8x slower
    # Read max 100 KiB
    read -r -N $((100 * 1024)) string < file

    # In Bash: POSIX, 2.3x slower
    string=$(cat file)

    # --------------------------------
    # Different shells compared.
    # --------------------------------

    Run shell: dash
    # t1 IsFeatureCommandSubstitutionReadFile<skip>
    # t2 IsFeatureReadOptionN <skip>
    # t3                      real 0.013s $(cat file)
    Run shell: ksh93
    # t1                      real 0.088s
    # t2                      real 0.095s
    # t3                      real 0.267s
    Run shell: bash
    # t1                      real 0.139s
    # t2                      real 0.254s
    # t3                      real 0.312s
```

## 3.5 MINOR PERFORMANCE GAINS

According to the results, none of
these offer practical benefits.
See the [RESULTS](./doc/RESULTS.md)
for details and further commentary.

- The Bash
  [brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Brace-Expansion) `{N..M}` might offer a
  minuscule advantage, but it may be impractical
  because `N..M` cannot be parameterized.
  Surprisingly, the simple and elegant `$(seq N M)`
  is fast, even though
  [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Substitution)
  uses a subshell. We can only guess that the
  reason is that any kind of looping, increments,
  and tests are inherently slow. The last POSIX
  `while` loop example was slightly slower in all
  subsequent tests.
  See [code](./bin/t-statement-arithmetic-for-loop.sh).

```bash

    N=1
    M=100

    # Bash
    for i in {1..100}
    do
        ...
    done

    # POSIX, fast
    for i in $(seq $N $M)
    do
        ...
    done

    # Bash, slow
    for ((i=$N; i <= $M; i++))
    do
        ...
    done

    # POSIX, slowest
    i=$N
    while [ "$i" -le "$M" ]
    do
        i=$((i + 1))
    done
```

- One might think that choosing optimized
  `grep` options would make a difference.
  In practice, for typical file sizes
  (below few Megabytes),
  performance is nearly identical
  even with the ignore case option included.
  Nonetheless, there may
  be cases where selecting `LANG=C`, using
  `--fixed-strings`, and avoiding
  `--ignore-case` might improve performance,
  at least according to StackOverflow
  discussions with large files.
  See [code](./bin/t-command-grep.sh).

```bash
    # The same performance. Regexp engine
    # does not seem to be the bottleneck

    LANG=C grep --fixed-strings ...
    LANG=C grep --extended-regexp ...
    LANG=C grep --perl-regexp ...
    LANG=C grep <any of above> --ignore-case ...
```

## 3.6 NO PERFORMANCE GAINS

None of these offer any advantages to speed up shell scripts.

- The Bash-specific expression
  [`[[ ]]`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-_005b_005b)
  might offer a
  minuscule advantage but only in loops of
  10,000 iterations. Unless the safeguards
  provided by Bash `[[ ]]` are important, the
  POSIX tests will do fine.
  See [code](./bin/t-statement-if-test-posix-vs-bash.sh).

```bash
    [ "$var" = "1" ] # POSIX
    [[ $var = 1 ]]   # Bash

    [ ! "$var" ]     # POSIX
    [[ ! $var ]]     # Bash
    [ -z "$var" ]    # archaic
```

- There are no practical differences between
  these. The POSIX
  [arithmetic expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Arithmetic-Expansion)
  `$(())`
  compound command
  will do fine. Note that the odd-looking
  null command
  [`:`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html)
  utilizes the command's side effect
  to "do nothing, but evaluate elements"
  and therefore may not be the most
  readable option.
  See [code](./bin/t-statement-arithmetic-increment.sh).

```bash
    i=$((i + 1))     # POSIX (preferred)
    : $((i++))       # POSIX, Uhm
    : $((i = i + 1)) # POSIX, Uhm!
    ((i++))          # Bash, Ksh
    let i++          # Bash, Ksh
```

- There is no performance
  difference between a
  Bash-specific expression
  [`[[ ]]`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-_005b_005b)
  for pattern matching compared
  to POSIX `case..esac`.
  Interestingly pattern matching
  is 4x slower under `dash` compared
  to Bash. However, that means nothing
  because the time differences
  are measured in minuscule
  milliseconds (0.002s).
  See [code](./bin/t-string-match-pattern.sh).

```bash
    string="abcdef"
    pattern="*cd*"

    # Bash
    [[ $string == $pattern ]]

    # POSIX
    case $string in
        $pattern)
            true
            ;;
        *)
            false
            ;;
    esac

```

- There is no performance
  difference between a
  regular while loop and a
  [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)
  loop. However, the latter is more general,
  as any variable set during the loop will
  persist after *and* there is no need to clean
  up temporary files like in POSIX (1) solution.
  The POSIX (1) loop is marginally faster but
  the speed gain is lost by the extra `rm` command.
  See [code](./bin/t-command-output-vs-process-substitution.sh).

```bash
    # Bash, Ksh
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done < <(command)

    # POSIX (1)
    # Same, but with
    # temporary file
    command > file
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done < file
    rm file

    # POSIX (2)
    # while is being run in
    # separate environment
    # due to pipe(|)
    command |
    while read -r ...
    do
        ...
    done
```

- With `grep`, the use of
  [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/),
  a `perl` program,
  makes things notably slower for typical file
  sizes. The idea of splitting a file into
  chunks of lines and running the search in
  parallel is intriguing, but the overhead of
  starting perl with `parallel` is orders of
  magnitude more expensive compared to running
  already optimized `grep` only once.
  Usually the limiting factor when grepping a
  file is the disk's I/O speed.
  Otherwise, GNU `parallel` is
  excellent for making full use of multiple
  cores. Based on StackOverflow discussions,
  if file sizes are in the several
  hundreds of megabytes,
  GNU
  [`parallel`](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
  can help speed things up.
  See [code](./bin/t-command-grep-parallel.sh).

```bash
    # Possibly add: --block -1
    parallel --pipepart --arg-file "$largefile" grep "$re"
```

# 4.0 PORTABILITY

## 4.1 LEGACY SHELL SCRIPTING

In typical cases, the legacy `sh`
([Bourne Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell))
is not a relevant target for shell scripting.
The Linux and and modern UNIX operating systems
have long provided an
`sh` that is POSIX-compliant enough. Nowadays
`sh` is usually a symbolic link to
[dash](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash)
(on Linux since 2006),
[ksh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ksh93u+m)
(on some BSDs), or it may point to
[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
(on macOS).

Examples of pre-2000 shell scripting:

```bash
    if [ x"$a" = "y" ]; then ...

    # Variable lenght is non-zero
    if [ -n "$a" ] ...

    # Variable lenght is zero
    if [ -z "$a" ] ...

    # Deprecated in next POSIX version.
    # Operands are also not portable.
    # -o (OR)
    # -a (AND)
    if [ "$a" = "y" -o "$b" = "y" ] ...

    # POSIX allows leading opening "(" paren
    case abc in
        (a*) true
             ;;
        (*)  false
             ;;
    esac

```

Modern equivalents:

```bash

    # Equality
    if [ "$a" = "y" ] ..

    # Variable has something
    if [ "$a" ] ...

    # Variable is empty
    if [ ! "$a" ] ...

    if [ "$a" = "y" ] || [ "$b" = "y" ]; then ...

    # Without leading "(" paren
    case abc in
         a*) :  # "true" might not be builtin
             ;;
         *)  false
             ;;
    esac

```

## 4.2 REQUIREMENTS AND SHELL SCRIPTS

Writing shell scripts inherently
involves considering several factors.

- *Personal scripts.* When writing
  scripts for personal or
  administrative tasks, the choice of
  shell is unimportant. On Linux, the
  obvious choice is Bash. On BSD systems,
  it would be Ksh. On macOS, Zsh might be
  handy.

- *Portable scripts.* If you intend to use the
  scripts across some operating systems — from
  Linux to Windows
  ([Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/),
  [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com),
  [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) [\*][\*\*]) —
  the obvious choice would be Bash. Between macOS and
  Linux, writing scripts in Bash is generally
  more portable than writing them in
  Zsh because Linux doesn't have Zsh installed
  by default. With macOS however, the choice
  of Bash is a bit more involved (see next).

- *POSIX-compliant scripts*. If you intend to
  use the scripts across a variety of operating
  systems — from Linux, BSD, and macOS to various
  Windows Linux-like environments — the issues
  become quite complex.
  You are probably better off writing `sh`
  POSIX-compliant scripts and testing them with
  [dash](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash),
  since relying on Bash can lead to
  unexpected issues — different systems have
  different Bash versions, and there’s no
  guarantee that a script written on Linux will
  run without problems on older Bash versions,
  such as the outdated 3.2 version in `/bin/bash`
  on macOS. Requiring users to install a newer
  version on macOS is not trivial because
  `/bin/bash` is not replaceable.

[\*] "Git Bash" is available with the popular
native Windows installation of Git. Under the
hood, it is based on MSYS, which in turn is
based on Cygwin... so the common denominator of
all native Windows Linux-like environments is the
Cygwin base. In all practical terms, it
provides the same Linux-like command-line
utilities, including Bash. For curious readers,
Windows
[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net),
a Swiss-army knife for terminals and connectivity,
includes a Cygwin-based Bash shell with its own `apt`-style
Debian-like package manager to install additional
Linux software.

[\*\*] In Windows, there is also the Windows
Subsystem for Linux
([WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)),
where you can install Linux distributions like
Debian and Ubuntu. Bash is the obvious choice
for shell scripts in this environment.

## 4.3 WRITING POSIX COMPLIANT SHELL SCRIPS

As this document is more focused on
Linux, macOS, and BSD compatibility,
and less on legacy UNIX operating
systems, for all practical purposes,
there is no need to attempt to write
*pure* POSIX shell scripts. Stricter
measures are required only if you
target legacy UNIX operating systems
whose `sh` may not have changed in 30
years. your best guide probably is
the wealth of knowledge collected by
the GNU autoconf project; see
["11 Portable Shell Programming"](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.72/autoconf.html#Portable-Shell).
For more discussion see
[4.6 MISCELLANEUS NOTES](#46-miscellaneus-notes).

Let's first consider the typical `sh`
shells in order of their
strictness to POSIX:

- [posh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/posh).
  Minimal `sh`, Policy-compliant Ordinary SHell.
  Very close to POSIX. Stricter than
  `dash`. Supports `local` keyword
  to define local variables in functions. The
  keyword is not defined in POSIX.
- [dash](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash).
  Minimal `sh`, Debian Almquish Shell.
  Close to POSIX. Supports `local` keyword.
  The shell aims to meet the
  requirements of the Debian Linux distribution.
- [Busybox ash](https://www.busybox.net) is based
  on `dash` with some more features added.
  Supports `local` keyword.
  See ServerFault ["What's the Busybox default shell?"](https://serverfault.com/questions/241959/whats-the-busybox-default-shell)

Let's also consider what the `/bin/sh` might
be in different Operating Systems.
For more about the history of the `sh` shell,
see the well-rounded discussion on StackExchange.
[What does it mean to be "sh compatible"?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/145522)

</picture>

- On Linux, most distributions already use, or
  are moving towards using, `sh` as a symlink to
  [dash](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dash).
  Older Linux versions (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS)
  used to have `sh` to be a symlink to `bash`.
- On the most conservative NetBSD, it is `ash`,
  the old
  [Almquist shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell).
  On FreeBSD, `sh` is also `ash`.
  On
  [OpenBSD, sh](https://man.netbsd.org/sh.1) is
  [ksh93](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ksh93u+m)
  from the
  [Ksh family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell).
- On many commercial, conservative UNIX systems
  `sh` is nowadays quite capable
  [ksh93](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ksh93u+m).
- On macOS, `sh` points to `bash --posix`, where
  the Bash version is indefinitely stuck at
  version 3.2.x due to Apple avoiding the GPL-3
  license in later Bash versions. If you write
  `/bin/sh` scripts in macOS, it is good idead
  to check them for portability with:

```bash
    # Check better /bin/sh compliance
    dash -nx script.sh
    posh -nx script.sh
```

In practical terms, if you plan to aim
for POSIX-compliant shell scripts, the best
shells for testing would be `posh` and `dash`.
You can also extend testing with BSD Ksh
shells and other shells. See
[FURTHER READING](#further-reading) for external
utilities to check and improve shell
scripts even more.

    # Save in shell startup file
    # like ~/.bashrc

    shelltest()
    {
        local script shell

        for script in "$@"
        do
            for shell in \
                posh \
                dash \
                "busybox ash" \
                mksh \
                ksh \
                bash \
                zsh
            do
                if command -v "$shell" > /dev/null; then
                    echo "-- shell: $shell"
                    $shell -nx "$script"
                fi
            done
        done
    }

    # Use is like:
    shelltest script.sh

    # External utility to check code
    shellcheck script.sh

    # External utility to check code
    checkbashisms script.sh

## 4.4 SHEBANG LINE IN SCRIPTS

Note that POSIX does not define the
[shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))
— the traditional first line that indicates
which interpreter to use. See
[exec family of functions' RATIONALE](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/exec.html#tag_16_111_08)

> (...) Another way that some historical
> implementations handle shell scripts is by
> recognizing the first two bytes of the file as
> the character string "#!" and using the
> remainder of the first line of the file as the
> name of the command interpreter to execute.

The first bytes of a script typically contain
two special ASCII codes, a special comment `#!`
if you wish, which is read by the kernel. Note
that this is a de facto convention, universally
supported even though it is not defined by
POSIX.

    #! <interpreter> [word]
    #
    # 1. whitespace is allowed after "#!"
    #    for readability.
    #
    # 2. The <interpreter> must be full
    #     path name. Not like:
    #
    #    #! sh
    #
    # 3. ONE word can be added
    #    after the <interpreter>.
    #    Any more than that may not
    #    be portable accross Linux
    #    and some BSD Kernels.
    #
    #    #! /bin/sh -eu
    #    #! /usr/bin/awk -f
    #    #! /usr/bin/env bash
    #    #! /usr/bin/env python3

### 4.4.1 About Bash and Shebang

Note that on macOS, `/bin/bash` is hard-coded
to Bash version 3.2.57 where in 2025 lastest Bash is
[5.2](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bash).
You cannot uninstall it, even with root
access, without disabling System
Integrity Protection. If you install a
newer Bash version with `brew install
bash`, it will be located in
`/usr/local/bin/bash`.

On macOS, to use the latest Bash, the
user must arrange `/usr/local/bin`
first in
[PATH](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#:~:text=This%20variable%20shall%20represent%20the%20sequence%20of%20path%20prefixes).
If the script starts
with `#! /bin/bash`, the user cannot
arrange it to run under different Bash
version without modifying the
script itself, or after modifying `PATH`,
run it inconveniently with
`bash <script>`.

    ... traditional

    #! /bin/bash

    ... more portable (macOS)

    #! /usr/bin/env bash

### 4.4.2 About Python and Shebang

There was a disruptive change from
Python 2.x to Python 3.x in 2008. The older
programs did not run without changes with the
new version. In Python programs, the shebang
should specify the Python version explicitly,
either with `python` (2.x) or `python3`.

    ... The de facto interpreters

    #! /usr/bin/python
    #! /usr/bin/python3

    .... not supported

    #! /usr/bin/python2
    #! /usr/bin/python3.13.2

But this is not all.
Python is also one of those languages which might
require multiple virtual environments based on
projects. It is typical to manage these
environments with tools like
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/)
or older
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io),
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
etc. For even better portability,
the following would allow
user to use his active Python environment:

    ... even better portability

    #! /usr/bin/env python3

The fine print here is that
[`env`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/env.html)
is a standard POSIX utility, but its path
is not mandated by POSIX. However,
in 99.9% of cases, the de facto portable
location is `/usr/bin/env`.

## 4.5 PORTABILITY OF UTILITIES

In the end, the actual implementation
of the shell you use (dash, bash, ksh...)
is less important than what utilities
you use and how you use them.

It's not just about choosing to write in
POSIX-like `sh`; the utilities called from
the script also has to be considered. Those
of `echo`, `cut`, `tail` make big part
of of the scripts. If you want to
ensure portability, check options defined in
[POSIX 2018](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/).
See top left menu "Shell & Utilities"
followed by bottom left menu
["4. Utilities"](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html)

Notable observations:

- Use POSIX
  [`command -v`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/command.html)
  to check if command exists.
  Note that POSIX also defines
  [`type`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/type.html),
  as in `type <command>`
  without any options. POSIX also
  defines utility
  [`hash`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/type.html),
  as in `hash <command>`.
  Problem with `type` is that the
  semantics, return codes, support or
  output are not necessarily uniform.
  Problem with `hash` are similar.
  Neither `type` nor `hash` is supported
  by `posh`; see table
  [RESULTS-PORTABILITY](./doc/RESULTS-PORTABILITY.txt).
  NOTE: The `which <command>`
  is neither in POSIX nor portable. For more
  information about `which`, see shellcheck
  [SC2230](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2230),
  BashFAQ [081](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/081),
  StackOverflow discussion
  ["How can I check if a program exists from a Bash script?"](https://stackoverflow.com/q/592620),
  and Debian project plan about deprecating
  the command in LWN article
  ["Debian's which hunt"](https://lwn.net/Articles/874049/).

```bash
    REQUIRE="sqlite curl"

    RequireFeatures ()
    {
        local cmd

        for cmd # implicit "$@" loop
        do
            if ! command -v "$cmd" > /dev/null; then
                echo "ERROR: missing required command: $cmd" >&2
                return 1
            fi
        done
    }

    # Before program starts
    RequireFeatures $REQUIRE || exit $?
    ...
```

- Use plain
  [`echo`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html)
  without any options. Use
  [`printf`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/printf.html)
  when more is needed.
  In POSIX `sh` shells,
  the `printf` command may not be a built-in,
  so using it can have performance considerations.


```bash
    # POSIX
    echo "line"                # (1)
    echo "line"
    printf "no newline"        # (2)

    # Not POSIX
    echo -e "line\nline"       # (1)
    echo -n "no newline"       # (2)

```

- Use [`grep -E`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html).
  In 2001 POSIX dropped `egrep`.

- Use [`shift N`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/shift.html)
  always with shell special parameter
  [`$#`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_05_02)

```bash
    set -- 1

    # POSIX
    # shift number of positional args
    shift $#

    # With any greater number,
    # terminates the whole program.
    # in dash, posh, mksh, ksh93...
    shift 2
```

- [`read`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/read.html).
  POSIX requires a VARIABLE, so
  always supply one. The command does
  not default to `REPLY`if omitted, The only option
  supported is `-r` which you should also always
  use. The `-N` option
  to read file into memory
  is only available in modern shells (Bash, Ksh).
  See shellcheck [SC2162](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2162),
  BashFAQ [001](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001),
  POSIX [IFS](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#:~:text=A%20string%20treated%20as%20a%20list%20of%20characters)
  and
  BashWiki [IFS](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/IFS).

```bash
   # POSIX
   REPLY=$(cat file)

   # Bash, Ksh
   # Read max 100 KiB to $REPLY
   read -N $((100 * 1024)) REPLY < file

   case $REPLY in
        *pattern*)
            # match
            ;;
   esac
```

### 4.5.1 Case Study: sed

As a case study, the Linux GNU `sed(1)` and
its options differ or
are incompatible. The Linux GNU
[`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)
`--in-place` option for replacing file content
cannot be used in macOS and BSD. Additionally,
in macOS and BSD, you will find GNU programs
under a `g`-prefix, such as `gsed(1)`, etc.
See StackOverflow ["sed command with -i option failing on Mac, but works on Linux"](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4247068). For more
discussions about the topic, see
StackOverflow [1](https://stackoverflow.com/q/48712373),
StackOverflow [2](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16745988),
StackOverflow [3](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7573368).

    # Linux (works)
    #
    # GNU sed(1). Replace 'this' with
    # 'that'

    sed -i 's/this/that/g' file

    # macOS (does not work)
    #
    # This does not work. The '-i'
    # option has different syntax and
    # semantics. There is no workaround
    # to make the '-i' option work
    # across all operating systems.

    sed -i 's/this/that/g' file

    # Maybe portable
    #
    # In many cases Perl
    # might be available although it
    # is not part of the POSIX
    # utilities.

    perl -i -pe 's/this/that/g' file

    # Portable
    # Avoiding -i option.

    tmp=$(mktemp)
    sed 's/this/that/g' file > "$tmp"
    mv "$tmp" file
    rm -f "$tmp"

### 4.5.2 Case Study: awk

POSIX
[`awk`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html),
does not support the `-v`
option to define variables.
You can use assignments after
the program instead.

    # POSIX
    awk '{print var}' var=1 file

    # GNU awk
    awk -v var=1 '{print var}' file

However, don't forget that
such assignments are not evaluated
until they are encountered, that is,
after any `BEGIN` action. To use
awk for operands without any files:

    # POSIX
    var=1 awk 'BEGIN {print ENVIRON["var"] + 1}' < /dev/null

    # GNU awk
    awk -v var=1 'BEGIN {print var + 1; exit}'


## 4.6 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

- The shell's null command
  [`:`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html)
  might be slightly preferrable than
  utlity
  [`true`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/true.html)
  according to
  GNU autoconf's manaual
  ["11.14 Limitations of Shell Builtins"](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.72/autoconf.html#Limitations-of-Builtins)
  which states that `:` might not be always builtin.

```bash
    while :
    do
        break
    done

    # Create an empty file
    : > file

```

- Prefer POSIX
  [`$(cmd)`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_03)
  command substitution instead of
  leagacy POSIX backtics as in \`cmd\`. For more
  information, see
  BashFaq [098](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082)
  and shellcheck
  [SC2006](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2006).
  For 20 years all the modern `sh` shells have supported
  `$()`. Including UNIX like AIX,
  HP-UX and conservative
  Oracle Solaris 10 (2005) whose
  support ends in
[2026](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/29/oracle_extends_solaris_support/#:~:text=During%202023%2C%20Oracle%20added%20another,2027%20instead%20of%20during%202024)
  (see Solaris
  [version history](https://www.liquisearch.com/solaris_operating_system/version_history)).

```bash
        # Easily nested
        lastdir=$(basename $(pwd))

        # Readabilty problems
        lastdir=`basename \`pwd\``
```

# 5.0 RANDOM NOTES

See the Bash manual how to use
[`time`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pipeline)
reserved word with
[TIMEFORMAT](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-TIMEFORMAT)
variable to display results in different
formats. The use of time as a reserved word
permits the timing of shell builtins, shell
functions, and pipelines.

    TIMEFORMAT='real: %R'  # '%R %U %S'

You could also drop kernel cache before
testing:

    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

- See Greg's Bash Wiki and FAQ
  https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide
- List of which features were added to specific
  releases of Bash
  https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/061
- Use `shellcheck` (Haskell) to
  to help to
  improve and write portable POSIX scripts.
  It can statically Lint scripts for potential
  mistakes. There is also a web interface where
  you can upload the script at
  https://www.shellcheck.net. In Debian,
  see package "shellcheck". See manual page at
  https://manpages.debian.org/testing/shellcheck/shellcheck.1.en.html
- Use `checkbashisms` command to help to
  improve and write portable POSIX scripts.
  In Debian, the command is available
  in package "devscripts". See
  https://manpages.debian.org/testing/devscripts/checkbashisms.1.en.html
